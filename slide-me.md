<!--
So, let me introduce myself a bit, my...

As you can see, I am pretty enthusiastic about open source which driven me to work on many projects. I love building tools, and figuring out solutions to the problems I encounter. For example, the slides you are looking at are powered by Slidev, a markdown-based presentation tool that is built on top of Web technologies. It was born when I found the existing tools were not flexible enough for me to present my code.

Similarly, when I looked into ESLint and its ecosystem a few months ago, I found many things are interesting with a lot potential by not yet fully explored. So today, I'd like to share with you some of my findings and practices during my recent exploration around it.
